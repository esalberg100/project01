### Getting Started

### Setting up your development environment

Recommended OS: **Mac OS High Sierra** or **Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**

## 1. Install Firebase

For `firebase init` you will need to follow the CLI prompts to initialize the Trof project. The project ID is `newsocialnetwork-ce19e`

```
$ npm install -g firebase-tools
$ firebase init    # Generate a firebase.json (REQUIRED) this is where you will need to use the project ID
```

Generate the files as recommended with the default names.

## 2. Set up GitHub repository

## 3. Setup a localhost server

Start a development server by running `$ firebase serve` in the CLI.

The server will run on localhost:5000.

## 4. Deploy

Ensure that all files are saved. Commit all files to a staging branch in GitHub. It is not recommended to commit to the master branch.

In the CLI, run `firebase deploy` to build the current project. This may take a minute.
